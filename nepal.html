It has three geographical zones. Himalayan, Mountainous and tarai. We have monsoon climate. It is very cold and dry in winter and hot, stormy and rainy in summer. It is rich in natural beauty and resources. It has long and wide rivers like koshi, Gandaki, and Karnali. We have large lakes like Rupa, Begnas, and Rara etc. like-wise we have green valleys, lovely water falls etc.  It is rich in religious and historical heritages. Lumbini, Gorkha,   Janakpur, Kathmandu are the famous examples.</P>
<P>epal is a country of highly diverse and rich geography, culture, and religions. The mountainous north has eight of the world's ten highest mountains, including the highest, Sagarmatha, known in English as Mount Everest. The fertile and humid south is heavily urbanized. It contains over 240 peaks more than 20,000 ft. (6,096 m) above sea.</P>
<P>People of many    castes and religions leave here. About hundred languages are spoken. Our popular foods are dal bhat, dhindo, gundurk etc. dashain, tihar,losar,Id etc. are the most popular festivals. They observe these festivals very happily.</P>
<p>Most people are farmers. They grow rice, corn, wheat,millet,barley,potato etc. some people in the cities are businessmen. Some have industries. They are very laborious and polite.</p>
<p>Due to the reach in natural resources, tourists love to visit your country. They can see endangered birds and animals here. They can see natural beauty, too. So tourism is our potential industry.</p>
<P>Nepal is small but rich in natural resources although it is poor by economic condition. Nepal is developing country. To develop soon, from today we have to aware all of the citizenship of country. Give to education equally both men and women, government should have to bring advance program and help citizen by providing different facilities which gives benefit to both citizen and government. Nepal is a beautiful country. So, we have to publish it all over the world which directly or indirectly helps to attract tourist and we can control our economic condition.  Success is achieved by developing our strengths, not by eliminating our weaknesses.</P></b></footer>
